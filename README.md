# SMWG-DETR

This repository provides the **official implementation** of the method proposed in the paper:

> **SMWG-DETR: DETR Enhanced by Fourier Spectral Modulation and Wavelet-Guided Fusion for Tiny Object Detection**

---

## Overview

SMWG-DETR is a DETR-based tiny object detection framework that enhances feature representations by integrating **Fourier spectral modulation** and **wavelet-guided feature fusion**.  
The method is designed to improve the discriminability and structural consistency of tiny objects under complex backgrounds.

## Code Availability

The complete source code, including **training**, **evaluation**, and **model configuration files**, is currently under preparation and will be **released publicly upon acceptance of the paper**.
The codebase is being carefully organized and documented to facilitate future use by the research community.

## Status

- [x] Repository initialized  
- [ ] Code release (in preparation)  

---

*The repository will be updated once the paper is accepted. Please stay tuned.*
